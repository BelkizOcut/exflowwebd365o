# ExFlow web for D365O
ExFlow web for *Dynamics 365 for Operations* (D365O) runs in Azure as a fully scalable *Azure App Service*. ExFlow web is deployed into the tenantâ€™s Azure environment as a Resource Group that contains a Web Site and a Storage account. The website is further connected to the Azure AD and D365O thru a so called App Registration and communicates with D365O using the same security technology that D365O uses namely Azure AD and OAuth 2.0.

## Installation and updates
ExFlow web is installed by running the following PowerShell script ([Example.ps1](https://github.com/signupsoftware/exflowwebd365o/blob/master/Example.ps1)) in *Powershell ISE*.


```powershell
$Location                  = "northeurope" #Azure location notheurope, westeurope,... 
$Security_Admins           = "JOHANB,JERRY" #AX user name of web site administrators. Admins can translate texts, write welecome messages, ...
$DynamicsAXApiId           = "axtestdynamics365aos" #left part of the AX URL such as axtestdynamics365aos for https://axtestdynamics365aos.cloudax.dynamics.com
$ExFlowUserSecret          = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" #Your identity recieved by signupsoftware.com

$scriptPath = ((New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signupsoftware/exflowwebd365o/master/App-RegistrationDeployment.ps1'))
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([scriptblock]::Create($scriptPath)) -ArgumentList $Location,$Security_Admins,$DynamicsAXApiId,$ExFlowUserSecret 
```

The script downloads the latest ExFlow web release and installs all required Azure components into an Azure Resource Group. During installation, the web app is registered to communicate with the D365O API (web services). **Note that to apply product updates you just run the script again.**

### Instructions:
